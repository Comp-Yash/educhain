        "text = \"\"\"0:01 Hi, everyone. Welcome. In this video, I'm going to talk about LangGraph. So LangGraph is a framework, agentic framework by LangChain.\n",
        "0:10 So it is very similar to LangChain in many ways, but this is specifically created to create agents. So we are going to do the same thing, uh, we are going to create the same react agent, but this time we are going to use LangGraph.\n",
        "0:24 LangGraph is specifically useful when you want to create very complicated agents. First, let us learn about what LANGRAF is and then I'll tell you how architecture of React diagram works and then we will look into some code examples as well.\n",
        "0:40 First of all, let us just try to understand what LANGRAF is. LANGRAF is a framework of LANGChain ecosystem. So LANGChain has a lot of their own frameworks like Lancers, LANGsmith, LANGRAF, so on and so forth.\n",
        "0:54 So these are one of the many frameworks but Langraff is specifically created for creating complex agentic systems. So whenever you are creating agents, you're using Langshin, you're following a linear structure.\n",
        "1:08 So chain is a linear structure where you're sending a prompt that is going to a model, then it's going to a parser, so on and so forth.\n",
        "1:17 Langraff actually follows a cyclic structure rather than the linear structure and change. So, what are the few main components? The main components of lag graph are stateful graphs.\n",
        "1:29 So, you can actually create different nodes in your graph which can store certain information and that information can be changed upon certain foundations.\n",
        "1:39 And instead of traditional linear change, we will use cycles where the agent can loop back to a particular node as many times as it wants until the problem is solved.\n",
        "1:50 So, let me explain with an example. So let's say we are creating a very simple react agent. Let's say in the same question that we asked, what is the, what is two times age of Sharuka, right?\n",
        "2:03 Two times age of Sharuka, that's the question. So this is the question that we are going to ask the agent.\n",
        "2:16 So when Then this goes to the agent, agent has to use tools for two times. So in this case, let's say we have a search tool and we have a calculator tool.\n",
        "2:26 In the first case, the agent will go use the search tool to fetch the age. So it will have the age ready with it.\n",
        "2:35 Now it will decide that it will have to use the calculator agent. Then it will go back, use the calculator agent and fetch the answer.\n",
        "2:42 it. Once it has fetched the answer, we can define an end condition where it can go and end. So this is how you can create a simple react agent using Landgraph.\n",
        "2:53 And now let me show you how you can do that using code. Generally, coding with Landgraph is slightly more complicated compared to Langshin or other frameworks.\n",
        "3:04 But for standard frameworks like create, they have pre-built templates. So that will allow us to create agents within few lines of code.\n",
        "3:12 So, let me show you how that is done. The first step is to install all the necessary dependencies. So, once that is done, you can just save your open API key and I'll show you two examples for it.\n",
        "3:26 One is a simple example with two tools and in the second example, I will create some custom tools and I'll show you how you can create react agents with multiple tools as well.\n",
        "3:38 For the first example, I'm going to use the same tools as we have used before. So we'll be using two tools.\n",
        "3:45 So one will be a search tool and one will be a calculated tool. So this is the search tool from DuckDuckGo and we have created a function called Multiply and this is the function that we have created which takes into integers and spits out the multiplied answer of them.\n",
        "4:06 The way you define tools is very simple you can just import tool module from langchen core and whenever you do whenever you write a function you just need to mention a decorator saying that at tool so it's automatically we converted it into a tool so that is how simple it is to create tools using this\n",
        "4:25 . Just write a function and mention a decorator so we have created two tools and now let me create a react agent using langgraph.\n",
        "4:33 For this we are going to choose a pre-built template from langgraph so since react agent is very useful and most widely used so they have created a pre-built template that you can use directly.\n",
        "4:47 So I'm just importing create react agent and I'm going to use GPT4 mini model. And the tools are multiply and search tool.\n",
        "4:58 And now I'm going to create a graph. So let me run this. And you can visualize the graph as well.\n",
        "5:05 Since we are using the standard react agent, the graph will remain same, irrespective of what tools you have mentioned. So let's say in our case, the tools has two tools.\n",
        "5:16 So let's say if you have 10 tools here, this will have 10 tools, but the diagram won't change much in this case.\n",
        "5:25 I'm going to run a Langerast with the same prompt that we used before, and I'm going to ask what is 5 times the current age of Shahrukh Khan.\n",
        "5:34 So it has to do two searches. First, it'll have to do a Google search to fetch the current age. And in the second stage, it'll have to do a multiplication.\n",
        "5:42 So let us see the process that it has followed. and you can also note with Langer if it is very easy to see the thought process when you come back to Langer.\n",
        "5:54 The first step, this is the question that human ask that we asked. So what is five times the current age of Sharuka and then AI decided that it will have to use a tool called Doug Doug go and the query that it is asking Doug Doug go is what is the current age of Sharuka And it is fetching these all results\n",
        "6:13 from the internet and then it is fetching the current age which is 58 and then it is doing a multiplication tool and then it is giving us the answer.\n",
        "6:24 So you see that there is a multi step reasoning happening within the agent where it is going step by step.\n",
        "6:32 So that is great. So now let me show you a little more complicated example where instead of one tool we have three tools and I have taken all math tools and I will also show you the thought process as to how that is working.\n",
        "6:47 There are three tools, so one is the multiply tool as we have seen before. Now we also have a square root tool and we also have a power tool raised to the exponent tool.\n",
        "6:58 So now we have three tools, multiply, square root and power. In the next step, let us just create an agent with all the three tools and this is the simple structure that you need to follow from this.\n",
        "7:13 And you can display it, it will give you the same diagram anyway. Now the question goes something like this, what is the square root of 4 raised to the power of 10 multiplied by 5.\n",
        "7:27 So let us see if it is giving us a correct answer or not. This is the output that we got, this is the human message that we have given and the agent has break down that particular problem into three different parts and then we can see the step by step calculation and then we arrive at the sensor which\n",
        "7:47 seems to be correct. And you can go and run it for different use cases and you can cross verify if it is working correctly or not.\n",
        "7:55 So this is this is how you can create a simple react agent using land graph in the next video We will learn more about different agent frameworks and we will also do a deep dive into true area\"\"\""

        "0:19 Chatbots, chatbots, chatbots, chatbots. So everywhere you see whenever you interact with Genitive A, mostly it is through a chatbot. So if you look at how most of the world has interacted with generative way, it is through a chatbot.\n",
        "0:32 So most of the people have interacted with chat GPT, which is primarily a chat application. So if you want to interact with generative way as of today, a majority of people do that using a chatbot.\n",
        "0:44 So most of the generative way applications also have a chat interface. So I'll give you a few examples short. Having said that, if 80% or 90% of generative applications that are coming out today are based on a chat interface, it is very important for you to understand inner workings of the chatbot.\n",
        "1:05 Not just to be able to build the applications, but also to understand with the systems that you are interacting with.\n",
        "1:13 So it is very essential that you understand the concept of chatbots, how they are built, how you can build some of them and how do they internally work.\n",
        "1:21 So there are many many use cases of chatbots starting from a simple use case like a chatbot on your website where a user can come and talk to the website.\n",
        "1:31 So that is a form of chatbot. So there are a lot of Chrome extensions these days where you can just download a plugin and chat with the YouTube video that you're watching.\n",
        "1:40 So, there are chatbots like perplexity that we have introduced before, they also form a chat interface. So, this is not a simple chat interface, they all come with additional features like perplexity is a chatbot with internet functionality.\n",
        "1:57 So, let's say this particular chatbot is a chat interface with knowledge to a particular website's data. So, so is this particular plugin which has knowledge of that particular YouTube video.\n",
        "2:09 So, what we will try to do is that, in this module, the first part of what we will cover is to understand how these conversion chatbots work and in the next part of the module, we will try to understand concepts like RAG where you can ingest your own data like PDF, website URLs and videos to create these\n",
        "2:27 applications. To be able to do all of these things, you need to understand some core concepts of how to build these chatbots.\n",
        "2:35 So, few of the topics include chat completion API, so we have been working with the chat completion API even though you don't know, so I'll explain more about that.\n",
        "2:46 So, there are a lot of types of chat, different types of chat messages that you need to understand. And there is an important concept of memory, so whenever you are developing a chat board, memory is going to be a very important concept.\n",
        "3:00 So, after learning all these three concepts, I will show you some chat templates, which will allow you to create and deploy chatbots very easily.\n",
        "3:09 So, in the next lecture, I will cover these two topics, we will meet you there.\"\"\""
